5. Questions


## 1. Motivation

- The goal of our project was multiple.
- We aimed:
 + Collect information



## 2. Examples

- Zillow 
- Trulia
- CoStar 
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./trulia.png')
```

## 3. Goal of the project


- **Develop a tool to estimate average real-estate prices in Mexico City at the smallest geographic unit, and display it together with other relevant information.** The ultimate goal is that a user can take a more informed decision on an optimal location of a new home. 
- Other information include: 
 + Earthquake vulnerability
 + Average housing quality
 + Amenities and public and private services
 + Schools
 + Traffic
 + Average pollution levels
 + Public transport/Bike stations
 + Dangerous crossings
 + Crime
   
## 4. Data

- Data would come from different sources:
 + Real Estate Prices: Websites (webscraping)
 + Rest of the data:
     * Public sources (shape files, csv's)
     * National Institute of Statistics (INEGI)
     * Open Data Initiative for Mexico City
     * Open Data Initative (Federal Government)
     * National Council of Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL)
     * Google Maps API
     * (...)

   

## 5. Challenges

- Multiple sources of data (different websites, csv files, shapefiles, Googlemaps API)
- Estimate average prices from scraping websites, for the smallest geographic unit (interpolate prices in special cases)
- Integration of data in a coherent and friendly way
- Have enough estimate points for real-estate prices
