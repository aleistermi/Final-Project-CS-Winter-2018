## 1. Motivation

- Decisions to move from one neighborhood to another involve evaluating a wide range of elements: not only affordability, but also surrounding amenities, security and crime, or access to public transport, to name a few.  
- Housing prices by themselves are intended to condense all this information in a single number. In developed countries, it is usually the case that housing prices data is available, either from public or private sources.
- In developing countries, moving usually involves more information assymetries (i.e. pre- and post Sept-15 earthquake real estate prices). Moreover, data on housing prices provided by real estate companies is less abundant, accurate and comprehensive, and there is no public  data on the subject.

## 2. Examples

- Zillow 
- Trulia
- CoStar 
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./trulia.png')
```

## 3. Goal of the project


- **Develop a tool to estimate average real-estate prices in Mexico City at the smallest geographic unit, and display it together with other relevant information.** The ultimate goal is that a user can take a more informed decision on an optimal location of a new home. 
- Other information include: 
 + Earthquake vulnerability
 + Average housing quality
 + Amenities and public and private services
 + Schools
 + Traffic
 + Average pollution levels
 + Public transport/Bike stations
 + Dangerous crossings
 + Crime
   
## 4. Data

- Data would come from different sources:
 + Real Estate Prices: Websites (webscraping)
 + Rest of the data:
     * Public sources (shape files, csv's)
     * National Institute of Statistics (INEGI)
     * Open Data Initiative for Mexico City
     * Open Data Initative (Federal Government)
     * National Council of Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL)
     * Google Maps API
     * (...)

   

## 5. Challenges

- Multiple sources of data (different websites, csv files, shapefiles, Googlemaps API)
- Estimate average prices from scraping websites, for the smallest geographic unit (interpolate prices in special cases)
- Integration of data in a coherent and friendly way
- Have enough estimate points for real-estate prices


## 6. Questions?
